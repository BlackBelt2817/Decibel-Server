-- ~ [Intro]
-- ~ Ah!

-- ~ [Verse 1]
-- ~ Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
-- ~ The way that I want you to die
-- ~ Slow death, immense decay
-- ~ Showers that cleanse you of your life
-- ~ Forced in; like cattle, you run
-- ~ Stripped of your life''s worth
-- ~ Human mice for the angel of death
-- ~ Four hundred thousand more to die
-- ~ [Chorus]
-- ~ Angel of death
-- ~ Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

-- ~ [Verse 2]
-- ~ Sadistic, surgeon of demise
-- ~ Sadist of the noblest blood
-- ~ Destroying without mercy
-- ~ To benefit the Aryan race
-- ~ Surgery with no anesthesia
-- ~ Feel the knife pierce you intensely
-- ~ Inferior, no use to mankind
-- ~ Strapped down, screaming out to die

-- ~ [Chorus]
-- ~ Angel of death
-- ~ Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
-- ~ Infamous butcher
-- ~ Angel of death

-- ~ [Verse 3]
-- ~ Pumped with fluid inside your brain
-- ~ Pressure in your skull begins
-- ~ Pushing through your eyes
-- ~ Burning flesh drips away
-- ~ Test of heat burns your skin
-- ~ Your mind starts to boil
-- ~ Frigid cold cracks your limbs
-- ~ How long can you last
-- ~ In this frozen-water burial?
-- ~ Sewn together, joining heads
-- ~ Just a matter of time
-- ~ Till you rip yourselves apart

-- ~ [Bridge]
-- ~ Millions laid out in their
-- ~ Crowded tombs
-- ~ Sickening ways to achieve
-- ~ The Holocaust

-- ~ [Verse 4]
-- ~ Seas of blood bury life
-- ~ Smell your death as it burns
-- ~ Deep inside of you
-- ~ Abacinate, eyes that bleed
-- ~ Praying for the end of
-- ~ Your wide-awake nightmare
-- ~ Wings of pain reach out for you
-- ~ His face of death staring down
-- ~ Your blood''s running cold
-- ~ Injecting cells, dying eyes
-- ~ Feeding on the screams of
-- ~ The mutants he''s creating

-- ~ The girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar
-- ~ Havin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I''m the star

-- ~ This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
-- ~ Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls''ll come real quick
-- ~ It''s better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
-- ~ A couple of sips of this love potion, and she''ll be on your lap
-- ~ So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
-- ~ Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg
-- ~ He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much, much meaner
-- ~ But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina

-- ~ Time killing, phone ringing, day dreaming
-- ~ She says that she''s gonna leave someday
-- ~ They tell her, "Don''t worry, we know it
-- ~ That''s life and we all feel the same way."
-- ~ She sits and stares out the window
-- ~ Hears every word they''re saying
-- ~ But if we all want to get out
-- ~ Why do we keep on waiting?

-- ~ [Chorus]
-- ~ Before I lay my head down
-- ~ I pray the Lord my soul to keep
-- ~ I got the Devil on me
-- ~ So  Lord I''m prayin'' now
-- ~ Forgive me for my sin
-- ~ Knowin'' good and well I''ll probably do it again
-- ~ And be with them people lookin'' down on me
-- ~ But Lord don''t ever let ''em put their hands on me

-- ~ And his last name engraved in black
-- ~ Right there by the handle on the top
-- ~ I''d slide it out of the back of his station wagon

-- ~ Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship
-- ~ See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
-- ~ And watch him run to Grandma, crying on the dock

-- ~ That old tackle box

-- ~ I have charted a course to the Vineyard
-- ~ But tonight I am Nantucket bound
-- ~ We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
-- ~ Left this morning from the bell in Gardiner''s Bay

-- ~ Too proud to leave, I work my fingers to the bone

-- ~ So I could own my downeaster "Alexa"
-- ~ And I go where the ocean is deep
-- ~ There are giants out there in the canyons
-- ~ And a good captain can''t fall asleep
-- ~ I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
-- ~ I know there''s fish out there, but where God only knows
-- ~ They say these waters aren''t what they used to be
-- ~ But I got people back on land who count on me

-- ~ [Verse 3]
-- ~ So if you see my downeaster "Alexa"
-- ~ And if you work with the rod and the reel
-- ~ Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis

-- ~ I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
-- ~ She looked at me and smiled and said "You have plans for the night?"
-- ~ I said "Hopefully if things go well I''ll be with you tonight"
-- ~ So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another
-- ~ I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
-- ~ I didn''t know what to say I was hanging by a string

-- ~ Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

-- ~ We''ll be fighting in the streets
-- ~ With our children at our feet
-- ~ And the morals that they worship will be gone
-- ~ And the men who spurred us on
-- ~ Sit in judgment of all wrong
-- ~ They decide and the shotgun sings the song

-- ~ Smile and grin at the change all around
-- ~ I pick up my guitar and play
-- ~ Just like yesterday
-- ~ Then I''ll get on my knees and pray
-- ~ We don''t get fooled again

-- ~ The change, it had to come
-- ~ We knew it all along
-- ~ We were liberated from the fold, that''s all
-- ~ And the world looks just the same
-- ~ And history ain''t changed
-- ~ ''Cause the banners, they are flown in the next war

-- ~ I''ll tip my hat to the new constitution
-- ~ Take a bow for the new revolution
-- ~ Smile and grin at the change all around
-- ~ Pick up my guitar and play
-- ~ Just like yesterday
-- ~ Then I''ll get on my knees and pray
-- ~ We don''t get fooled again
-- ~ No, no!

-- ~ I''ll move myself and my family aside
-- ~ If we happen to be left half alive
-- ~ I''ll get all my papers and smile at the sky
-- ~ Though I know that the hypnotized never lie
-- ~ Do ya?

-- ~ Yeah!

-- ~ There''s nothing in the streets
-- ~ Looks any different to me
-- ~ And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
-- ~ And the parting on the left
-- ~ Is now parting on the right
-- ~ And the beards have all grown longer overnight

-- ~ I''ll tip my hat to the new constitution
-- ~ Take a bow for the new revolution
-- ~ Smile and grin at the change all around
-- ~ Pick up my guitar and play
-- ~ Just like yesterday
-- ~ Then I''ll get on my knees and pray

-- ~ Демоны знают и просят нули
-- ~ Голову кружат, их план обдурить
-- ~ Ярче звезд сияешь под ритм
-- ~ Краски ярче любой палитры
-- ~ Тело манит сильнее любого магнита
-- ~ Музыка сегодня без всяких лимитов
-- ~ Подойди ближе, можешь доверять
-- ~ Слёзы в глазах огнями горят
-- ~ Давай, танцуй, это всё для себя
